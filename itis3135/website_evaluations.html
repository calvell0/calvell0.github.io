        <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a></h3>
        <p>Youtube is a video sharing site, used across the world by hundreds of millions of people on a regular basis.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: Youtube does a great job at managing contrast; Nothing on the page is ever unnecessarily difficult to read or see.</li>
            <li>Repetition: There is very consistent formatting of video links and thumbnails, with each video option having multiple links; multiplet to the video itself, one to the page of the video creator, and a menu button.</li>
            <li>Alignment: There are very clear horizontal and vertical divisions throughout the site, resulting in a simple and user-friendly interface that doesn't feel jumbled or thrown together.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Youtube's interface is grouped into distinct sections, with a subscription bar, video suggestions, a menu bar, and a genre selector near the search bar. All relevant functions are grouped with similar functions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/">craigslist</a></h3>
        <p>craigslist is a website that allows people to sell things to others directly, typically by meeting in person.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: Color contrast is not a huge issue with craigslist, but it can still be difficult to read due to the sheer amount of small text that is on screen.</li>
            <li>Repetition: The site does a poor job with repetition, as nearly all text on the page uses the same font and colors, only differentiated by bold text on occasion.</li>
            <li>Alignment: Craigslist does a good job at aligning its elements, as none of it looks jumbled together and there are pretty clear divisions between page sections.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Many elements of the craigslist home page are grouped together, while sometimes being completely irrelevant to each other.</li>
        </ul>
